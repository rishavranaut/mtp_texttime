Of the 67 films that have won this award since it was first introduced in 1956, just six of them currently have articles linked to in [[Short Film Golden Bear]] -- if there are others that have articles but have been overlooked for linking, I don't have the depth of knowledge to find most of them -- and only two of them even had their articles properly linked in this template prior to me finding it just now, so that I had to wikilink them in here myself. I additionally caught one instance where a film that won this award in the 1980s was being erroneously dual-listed as also winning it in the 1970s instead of the film that actually won it in the earlier year -- and even that, I only caught because it was one of the titles I had to link, and thus had a ""hey, wait, didn't I already link that one?"" moment when I got to the second appearance, so there may still be other errors in here that I failed to notice.<br>Additionally, the article is so cluttered up, with the names of the directors alongside most (but not all) of the films, that it takes up more visual space on the few articles than necessary and it's somewhat difficult to even find the few wikilinks on a casual scan at all because they're strewn throughout so much unlinked text.<br>Obviously no prejudice against recreation in the future if and when a larger number of films listed here have articles to link -- but with very few films in this template actually having articles at present, and short films being much harder to write properly sourced articles about at the best of times due to receiving much less [[WP:GNG]]-worthy coverage as a rule, for the time being the article is sufficient and a navigation box isn't helpful.

Some differentiation occurs in response to [[antigen]] exposure.

The concession was to operate the 5,335-kilometer (3,315 mi) ""Northeast Railroad"" connecting Monterrey and Mexico City with a US port of entry at Laredo, Texas and seaports at Lázaro Cárdenas and Veracruz. This potentially very profitable concession was hotly bid on by many major companies, including the very large Union Pacific Railroad. Thie Northeast Railroad tracks carried 46% of all rail traffic in Mexico and 60% of all freight coming from and to the United States. Eleven of fourteen of Mexico's auto assembly plants, plus two more under construction, are located on this line. Auto and parts freight traffic accounted for 9% of the 2012 total carloads. <ref>Heaster, Randolph (December 6, 2005). ""Kansas City Southern Railroad Has A New Name"".

1224034041,"The Awards Ceremony, also known as the Closing Ceremony, takes place just before the end of a round. Traditionally, staff members stand on stage and announce the winners for the entire round. Winners either get a gold medal, silver medal, a pineapple (another form of trophy), or a trophy. The winner of the ''round'' gets the tallest trophy, and gets to interact with the props on the stage. Awards are also given to scholars who scored relatively well overall, but did not receive a gold medal or trophy for any particular event. These were initially called Da Vinci Awards, but their name was changed to the Asimov Award in 2023, as the award for the highest Challenge score, which was formerly named Asimov, had been renamed.

Clifton is a replica of a historical village with the tourists hidden, watching the village's activity by video from under the ground. Originally it was much more lenient with its villagers when a man named Miles Clifton founded it, but is now very strict and prevents anyone from leaving. Her mother asks her to retrieve a cure now that her own sister Katie has taken ill; the owners of the attraction ceased to provide modern medical care to the villagers in order to preserve its authenticity.
