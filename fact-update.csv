Albeit her young age the poems show the language and outlook of a much more mature person, and she certainly was a talent prematurely gone from life. Some of her poems became songs, very popular in Bulgaria since the 1980s: ''Зимна ваканция'' (Winter holidays), ''Пролет'' (Spring), ''Доброта'' (Kindness), ''Лунапарк'' (Fun-fair), ''Нощ над града'' (Night over the city).",2016-02-14T02:11:51Z,"Dubarova's poems have a style of certain frivolity, full of pastel colours and romanticism.

Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air.

"Even when there is a backline, musicians are typically expected to bring their own instruments and equipment, with the exception of keyboardists who play [[Hammond organ]] or [[grand piano]], who may be able to just come to the venue without any instruments or equipment. Guitarists typically bring their own [[electric guitar]]s, [[acoustic guitar]]s, and [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb and [[distortion (music)|distortion) pedals); bassists typically bring their own [[electric bass]]es, [[upright bass]] and any effects units (e.g., an [[audio compressor]] or bass [[preamplifier]]) which they regularly use; drummers will still have to bring their own [[snare drum]], [[drum stick]]s and, in some cases, [[cymbal]]s. Even though the musicians still have to bring their own instruments and gear, having a backline still speeds up the setup and soundchecking process. For example, with the bassist, the bass stack will already be set up on stage, plugged into the [[AC mains]] power, connected via the amp's [[DI box]] output to the [[mixing console]], and a [[microphone]] will be set up in front of the speaker (to capture the amp's tone).

"Share repurchases also allow companies to covertly distribute their earnings to investors without inflicting them with taxation. For example, if a company were to pay US$100,000 in dividends on one million shares or as 10¢ dividend per share, investors may incur tax upon this disbursement. This means that instead of receiving 10¢ of earnings per share, they receive 8.5¢ (.10×(1&nbsp;−&nbsp;.15)) at a 15% tax rate with 1.5¢ going to the government. An investor with 10 shares will receive 85¢. As the company has to pay out this money the share price drops accordingly, from US$10 to US$9.90, so the investor with 10 shares now has; US$99 + 85¢ dividend, or US$99.85. Of course, the market will not necessarily respond to a dividend payment by selling off shares and reducing share price; while the payment of the dividend technically reduces the company's book value, the ability and willingness to pay a dividend is often seen positively, and the share price may even increase.",2016-05-29T20:00:42Z,"Share repurchases also allow companies to distribute their earnings to investors without inflicting them with taxation.

As President, Patassé began to replace many ""southerners"" with ""northerners"" in these jobs which infuriated many Yakoma people in particular who had benefited from the patronage of former President Kolingba.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}",2016-10-13T21:33:21Z,"After the Kolingba regime sabotaged a first set of elections in 1992, which Patassé would have probably won, a second set of elections was held and on the second round on September 19, 1993, he came in first with 37 percent of the vote--well ahead of his nearest competitors, Kolingba, David Dacko and [[Abel Goumba]].

"Explaining why a simple stake was often used for executions, the book Das Kreuz und die Kreuzigung (The Cross and the Crucifixion), by Hermann Fulda, states: “Trees were not everywhere available at the places chosen for public execution. So a simple beam was sunk into the ground. On this the outlaws, with hands raised upward and often also with their feet, were bound or nailed.”  The most convincing proof of all, however, comes from God’s Word. The apostle Paul says: “Christ purchased us, releasing us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: ‘Accursed is every man hung upon a stake [“a tree,” King James Version].’” (Galatians 3:13) Here Paul quotes Deuteronomy 21:22, 23, which clearly refers to a stake, not a cross. Since such a means of execution made the person “a curse,” it would not be proper for Christians to decorate their homes with images of Christ on a cross.",2016-10-04T17:13:12Z,"Explaining why a simple stake was often used for executions, the book Das Kreuz und die Kreuzigung (The Cross and the Crucifixion), by Hermann Fulda, states: “Trees were not everywhere available at the places chosen for public execution.

"An electric [[musical instrument]], such as a [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar]], may have a kill switch, also known as a ""stutter switch"". They are typically used by [[heavy metal music]] and [[hardcore punk]] guitarists. A kill switch works by switching between the hot signal from a pick-up and the ground signal, and does not break the circuit. A typical way of achieving this is (on a guitar with a volume control for each pick-up) by turning down the volume on one of the pick-ups then alternating the pick-up selector switch between that pick-up and one with the volume turned up. They are sometimes used when a [[singer]] doubles as a guitar player and wants to mute her guitar from sounding during a vocal solo. Kill switches are also used as a special effect during a song, which enables a guitarist to play a chord or note and then have that chord or note ""stutter"" on and off in a rhythmic fashion. Kill switches are rarely a feature in consumer-grade, [[mass market]] instruments, although they are mainly an after-market modification and a feature that custom guitar shops can install. The kill switch circuit can also be built into an effects pedal and controlled by a foot switch.",2016-09-03T21:53:48Z,"An electric [[musical instrument]], such as a [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar]], may have a kill switch, also known as a ""stutter switch"".

"Marciano is commonly remembered as a swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but he has also been called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three. A late starter in the sport with little training and a short amateur career, he lacked the skills and finesse of most heavyweight champions, but he made up for it in brute force and raw power. He was notorious early in his career for his punching power, holding eleven first-round knockouts to his name. As the opposition got better, Marciano relied on his incredible stamina, relentlessness, and ability to fight rough and swarm on the inside to get him through fights just as much as the power. He would sometimes go entire fights being pummeled by opponents such as [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], [[Ezzard Charles]], and [[Archie Moore]] but would come on strong as his opponent faded. He was also noted for hitting his opposition on their arms while they were blocking. Although this didn't score points, over the rounds it made their arms numb and essentially useless. Rocky faced criticism over his career for poor foot movement and for taking too many shots: he utilized weaving but would often be caught coming in. This, however, did not matter because he was able to take the shots. He is now known for having one of the best chins in boxing history, being knocked down just twice in his entire career, both times more to do with poor balancing rather than being dazed.",2016-10-21T23:57:18Z,"Marciano is commonly remembered as a swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but he has also been called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three.

It was one of three exorcisms to have been sanctioned by the Catholic Church in the United States at that time. In order to make the film, Friedkin was allowed access to the diaries of the priests involved, as well as the doctors and nurses; he also discussed the events with the boy's aunt in great detail.

"On 14 October 1939, Prien risked shallow water, unknown shoals, tricky currents and detection by defenders to penetrate the [[Royal Navy]]'s primary base, [[Scapa Flow]]. Although most of the [[Home Fleet]] was at sea, Prien sank the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} and returned home to instant fame. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]], personally by [[Adolf Hitler]], and was the first sailor of the U-boat service and the second member of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' to receive this award. The mission into Scapa Flow called for volunteers only; Prien had no hesitation in accepting the mission. In a token to the voluntary nature of the mission, Prien spoke to his crew while ''U-47'' was lying off Scapa Flow, and having briefed them, he announced that anyone not wishing to volunteer could leave the boat immediately. Unsurprisingly, no one accepted the offer to disembark in the middle of the North Sea. Prien received the nickname ''Der Stier von Scapa Flow'' (''""The Bull of Scapa Flow""''); the emblem of a snorting bull was painted on the conning tower of ''U-47'' and soon became the emblem of the entire [[7th U-boat Flotilla]].
