MRCPs tend to resemble a ""set of plans"" used by the cortex for the generation and control of movement. The BP is activated by voluntary movements involving the SMA and the somatosensory cortex in movement preparation and initiation.  Initially only the late BP was considered to be specific for the site of movement and the early BP was thought to be characterized by more general preparation for upcoming movements.  However, over the past couple of decades the early BP is considered to perhaps also be site specific within the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the lateral premotor cortex.<ref name=""WhatisBP""/>  Using [[principal component analysis]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) the main source of early BP was determined to be Area 6 of the precentral gyrus bilaterally, and the main sources of late BP were determined to be Area 4 (also known as the Primary Motor Cortex) and Area 6.  The current consensus is that the early BP starts first in the SMA, including pre-SMA and SMA proper, and then approximately 400ms later in the lateral premotor cortices bilaterally prior to the movement onset, and the late BP starts in the M1 and premotor cortex contralaterally.<ref name=""WhatisBP""/><eod>",0
"<sod>Around 1809, impressed by the ""talking leaves"" of European written languages, Sequoyah began work to create a writing system for the Cherokee language. After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. Sequoyah took some ideas from his copy of the Bible, which he studied for characters to use in print, noticing the simplicity of the Roman letters and adopting them to make the writing of his syllabary easier. He could not actually read any of the letters in the book (as can be seen in certain characters in his syllabary, which look like Ws or 4s for example), so it is especially impressive that he came up with such a well-developed system.  He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion, and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created. The rapid dissemination of the syllabary is notable, and by 1824, most Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}}<eod>

"<sod>Upon its release, ''The Life of Pablo'' received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with particular attention drawn to its kaleidoscopic musical range and messy, unfinished composition. As [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] refused to disclose [[streaming data]] to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], it did not chart in the United States; in fact, it only charted in Denmark. Nonetheless, its exclusive release on Tidal resulted in a large increase in subscribers to the servers and broke piracy records with over 500,000 illegal downloads within the first three days of its release. According to Tidal, ''The Life of Pablo'' was streamed 250 million times in the first 10 days of its release, and on April 1, West released the full album for streaming on [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], and [[Google Play]].<eod>

"<sod>''Appearance and Reality'' comprises two volumes: ""Appearance"" and ""Reality"". Bradley argues in the first that most things, including objects and their qualities, time and space, causation, the self, and things-in-themselves, are appearances, while in the second he attempts to describe the reality these appearances misrepresent to us: the Absolute, a single cosmic experience of which people are components. Ordinary concepts provide a pragmatically useful way of thinking about the world, but being incoherent they cannot provide a satisfactory grasp of reality. Reality, as predicate, is a matter of degree: concepts are true or false of reality in different degrees. The concept of the Absolute is only a way of attempting to understand something that cannot be fully comprehended. Bradley tries to establish these conclusions by arguing that reality must have a unitary togetherness that cannot be captured by the ordinary conception of many distinct things in relation, and that all concrete reality must somehow be psychical in nature.<ref name=""Sprigge"" /><eod>

"<sod>The home and grounds quickly proved inadequate to support a preparatory school.  In the fall of 1899, [[Theodore Chickering Williams]] and Mr. Seaver Buck, the first headmaster and the first master hired, respectively, searched for additional land.

"<sod>An electric [[musical instrument]], such as a [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar]], may have a kill switch, also known as a ""stutter switch"". They are typically used by [[heavy metal music]] and [[hardcore punk]] guitarists. A kill switch works by switching between the hot signal from a pick-up and the ground signal, and does not break the circuit. A typical way of achieving this is (on a guitar with a volume control for each pick-up) by turning down the volume on one of the pick-ups then alternating the pick-up selector switch between that pick-up and one with the volume turned up. They are sometimes used when a [[singer]] doubles as a guitar player and wants to mute her guitar from sounding during a vocal solo. Kill switches are also used as a special effect during a song, which enables a guitarist to play a chord or note and then have that chord or note ""stutter"" on and off in a rhythmic fashion. Kill switches are rarely a feature in consumer-grade, [[mass market]] instruments, although they are mainly an after-market modification and a feature that custom guitar shops can install. The kill switch circuit can also be built into an effects pedal and controlled by a foot switch.<eod>

The majority of the Jewish population during the High Middle Ages lived in [[Iberia]] (what is now Spain and Portugal) and in the region of Mesopotamia and Persia (what is now Iran and Iraq), the former known as the Sefardim and the latter known as the Mizrahim. A substantial population existed also in central Europe, the so-called Ashkenazim.<ref>{cite web | url=http://www.theholocaustexplained.org/ks3/anti-semitism/medieval-anti-judaism/who-and-where-were-medieval-jews/#.WA-NnbP4dvs | title=Who and where were the medieval Jews? | website=The Holocaust Explained | accessdate=25 Oct 2016}}</ref> Following the the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion]] of Sephardim from Iberia during the 15th century, a mass migration into Ottoman Empire swelled the size of many eastern communities including those in Palestine; the town of [[Safed]] reached 30,000 Jews by end of the 16th century.

<sod>The main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a [[layer-3]] device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the [[layer-2]] data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, [[quality of service]] (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the [[State (computer science)|state]] information associated with individual packets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=22 July 2003}}</ref> Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.{{efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured.}}<eod>",1

"<sod>'''Ann Kipling''' (born 1934, Victoria, British Columbia) is a [[Canadian]] artist who creates [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] portraits and landscapes on paper from direct observation.  Kipling's distinctive style of overlapping, temporally suggestive linework is formed through her working process, which involves drawing her subject over time, recording subtle shifts in movement in the sitter or landscape during that period. Her work is characterized by a flat sense of space, where lines are used to frame a vibrating and gestural idea of her subject, rather than a direct representation of form. While not directly connected to any art movement in particular, connections can be made to Chinese landscape painters and the watercolours of [[Paul Cézanne]]. Using colour minimally, her primary media is etching, drawing, watercolours, pen, pencil, pastels and pencil crayons. She lives and works in Falkland, BC, a location which serves as a focus for her recent landscapes.<eod>

The resulting draw meant that SOE were knocked out of the title race. With the championship already decided, SOE decided to protest; according to some sources, there was an argument between the SOE coach and the referee himself. SOE deliberately scored 149 [[own goal]]s, with spectators saying that after each kick-off the ball was kicked into their own goal, the opposition players standing and looking bemused.

In the film, residents both in and near Ogden Marsh become infected with a a ""[[Rhabdoviridae]] prototype"" [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] called Trixie. At the end of the movie, David and Judy, who are unaffected victims within the affected area, arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle but discover that the National Guard have also executed those who were evacuated.

A view from a military satellite highlights first the couple, then the city of Cedar Rapids. The words ""Initiate containment protocol"" appear, signifying a new containment attempt by the National Guard. Later, during the credits, Bruce Aune, a real newscaster from KCRG-TV 9 in Cedar Rapids reports that an explosion originating from the Dakon Pendrill chemical plant started a massive fire in Ogden Marsh which is merely a cover story for the National Guard's actual destruction of the town. Bruce Aune then reports that a perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area.

Bruce Aune then reports that a perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area.

Rhodesia agreed and sent 44 athletes in eight sports (including a water polo squad) to Munich in its largest and most diverse delegation.
